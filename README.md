# SockShop-project

A microservices architecture divides an application into small, independent services that communicate over a network. In this project, we'll deploy SockShop, a containerized microservices-based application, using Kubernetes for orchestration.

SockShop includes several microservices, such as the front-end, carts, catalouge, payments and shipping. Each service operates independently but share relevant data accross the deployment. Each microservice is packaged in a docker image and kubernetes is used to deploy and orchestrate the communication between the different services.

Core DevOps practices will be employed to automate the deployment of SockShop, this DevOps practices will include: - Infrastructure as a Code to automate the provisioning of our resources - Container Orchestration - Monitoring, Logging & Alerts - Continous Development and Continuous Integration - Security.
